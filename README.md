This project uses **Machine Learning** to classify sonar signals as either **rock** or **mine** using **Logistic Regression**.

## 🚀 Features  
✔ Reads sonar data from a CSV file  
✔ Preprocesses and splits the dataset  
✔ Trains a **Logistic Regression** model  
✔ Accepts **user input** for real-time predictions  

## 📂 Tech Stack  
- **Python** 🐍  
- **NumPy, Pandas**  
- **Scikit-Learn**  

## 📌 How to Run  
1️⃣ Clone the repository:  
```bash
